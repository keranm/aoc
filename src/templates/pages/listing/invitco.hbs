### Invitbox - Accounts Payable Processing made simple.

Invitbox is the worldâ€™s first online automatic data-extraction mailbox for receipt, approval and storage of supplier bills.

Based in Sydney (but working in the cloud) invitbox allows you to receive and process your supplier bills without handling paper, and without any data entry. For good measure, invitbox then stores the bills it exports into MYOB in an intuitive online filing cabinet for the regulatory period. Say goodbye to paper, data-entry and filing cabinets. Slash the cost of your Accounts Payable processing.

Simply get your supplier bills emailed into ""yourco""@invitbox.com and within seconds the bill and the data will be presented to you for approval and export into MYOB.

Change the way you do things.

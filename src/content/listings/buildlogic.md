From the creation of an Estimate, using simple templates, rate and quantity breakdowns comes the Budget against which a Job is managed.

Progress Claims, Variations, Subcontractor Management and the MYOB integration module (in the Sales, Purchases, Payroll, Journals and Contact information) eliminates the needs to rekey information.

Provision of extensive management reporting including Budget versus Actual, Profit and Loss and Cashflow provide construction/project managers with a day by day view of how the job is tracking against the Budget. There is no waiting until the end of job to see the profitability of the job. Reports can be produced across jobs and financial years.

Finally, the production of client correspondence, such as quotations, variations, extension of time, purchase orders, subcontractor orders, are via tailored documents which provide for quick production of documentation by merging information out of data entered into Buildlogic. 

Construction staff are provided with up-to-date information about their Jobs basically on demand.

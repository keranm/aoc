We are based in Wellington, New Zealand but have a network of associates throughout New Zealand, Australia and a few other countries. We focus on developing software that helps businesses handle their accounting requirements with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency.\u000D\u000AWhen we started out, the company consisted of Steve Marriott and Peter Chung. We were supporting a proprietary financial package running on Data General hardware. The company has grown slowly but steadily until another company bought our accounting reseller division to setup as their Wellington office. We now have a smaller team just made up of developers and support staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EOur name came about during the development of our first package, WinFix, an asset management package. The statement was made late one afternoon that the package was \u0022pretty impressive\u0022. Someone else said that if we could move assets from one location to another using drag and drop (just like Windows Explorer), then that would be \u0022Very Impressive Software\u0022. We did get the movement of assets via drag and drop working in that very first version, so Very Impressive Software became our company name!\u003C/p\u003E",

Give businesses, like ours, useful tools that help them get these jobs done. Ease\u002Dof use is of utmost importance. Practicality and functionality are key. We believe that eye candy loses its appeal over time but a system that \u0027just works\u0027 [and doesnâ€™t get in the way of the work!] never does. And, weâ€™ve applied these principles to the development of a Customer Relationship Management system that is intuitive, full of helpful features and easy to integrate into your business.\u003C/p\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EWe also believe that any business implementing a new CRM system should start to see the benefits almost immediately. Return on investment should be measured in days, weeks at the most, certainly not months. We use the system weâ€™ve developed in our own business and we couldnâ€™t do what we do without it.\u003C/p\u003E",

We are based in Wellington, New Zealand but have a network of associates throughout New Zealand, Australia and a few other countries. We focus on developing software that helps businesses handle their accounting requirements with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency.\u000D\u000AWhen we started out, the company consisted of Steve Marriott and Peter Chung. We were supporting a proprietary financial package running on Data General hardware. The company has grown slowly but steadily until another company bought our accounting reseller division to setup as their Wellington office. We now have a smaller team just made up of developers and support staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u000D\u000A\u000D\u000A\u003Cp\u003EOur name came about during the development of our first package, WinFix, an asset management package. The statement was made late one afternoon that the package was \u0022pretty impressive\u0022. Someone else said that if we could move assets from one location to another using drag and drop (just like Windows Explorer), then that would be \u0022Very Impressive Software\u0022. We did get the movement of assets via drag and drop working in that very first version, so Very Impressive Software became our company name!\u003C/p\u003E",
